### **📚 About This Repository**
This repository serves as a personal space for me to record my AI learning process. It includes:
1. **Learning Notes**: Summaries of key concepts and ideas I’ve learned. These may not be comprehensive but reflect what I find important or interesting.
2. **Challenges & Reflections**: Notes on difficulties I’ve encountered, questions I’ve had.
3. **Resources**: A collection of useful courses, tools, articles, and communities I’ve come across during my studies.

### **🎯 My Goals**
1. **Build a Systematic Understanding of AI Concepts**: Covering machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP) and more.
2. **Stay Updated on Cutting-Edge Technologies**: Explore areas like generative AI, Transformer-based models, and reinforcement learning.
3. **Foster Open Collaboration**: Use this repository as a platform to connect with others who are also passionate about learning AI.
